--- EXERCISE 3.1

channel coin, tea, coffee

NOVM = coin -> (tea -> STOP |~| coffee -> STOP)
NVM = coin -> (tea -> NVM |~| coffee -> NVM)

assert NOVM :[deadlock free]
assert NVM :[deadlock free]

CM = coin -> coffee -> CM
TM = coin -> tea -> TM

NVM2 = CM |~| TM


--- CM |~| TM would choose one of CM or TM, and then it would remain a coffee machine, or a tea machine.
--- NVM will always be a tea/coffee machine, but which one of those it gives you isn't deterministic
assert NVM2 [F= NVM
